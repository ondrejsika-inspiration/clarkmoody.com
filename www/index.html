                <p>First of all, I love <a href="http://lhbc.net/about-christ" target="_blank">Jesus</a>, and I want you to know him. He has changed my life forever, and His love has the power to change you.</p>
                
                <p>I am the founder of the successful Bitcoin company, RTBTC, which was acquired by Blockchain in early 2014 and became the <a href="https://zeroblock.com/" target="_blank">ZeroBlock</a> trading platform. I was Lead Developer of ZeroBlock at <a href="https://blockchain.info/" target="_blank">Blockchain</a>, the company behind the most popular Bitcoin wallet.</p>

                <p>As a huge proponent of liberty, I believe that cryptographic technologies have the potential to bring economic, political, and religious freedom to billions around the world. Distributed systems such as <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> are leading the way. You will find my PGP public key in the Contact section.</p>
                
                <p>I studied Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, earning B.S. and M.S. degrees. The <a href="http://lasr.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">LASR Laboratory</a> was my home base during the course of my graduate studies, where I gained expertise in space robotic sensing and control.</p>
